# Revision paper

## Intro

The intro is in line with the reasoning explained in my previous email (to which I replied here). As a result, the reasoning in the intro didn't change so much, compared to the previous version. 

Furthermore:

- I added a part on how affordances automatically attract attention
- I shortened the part on the GE


## Stats

I didn't apply the suggestions for the analyses, for reasons that we discussed before. In a nutshell, I think the misunderstanding was solved by realizing:
	
- We do test the effect of handle orientation (or contrast, in the supplementary materials) by testing the difference of the normalized (flipped) landing positions against there reference point 
- The stats in the main text are performed on a different data set than the stats in the supplementary materials

The results of the LME are shown in a table now.

## Short Discussions at the end of Exp 1 and 2

I would like to keep these short, to avoid redundancy. I don't want to interpret our results in light of the three hypotheses after Exp 1 and after Exp 2 and in the GD.

## General Discussion

I think the most fundamental comment was that we shouldn't say that the CoG decayed. I completely agree with that.

Finally, to avoid confusion, I sometimes bluntly say what we didn't do in the current study, like

- About the PVL-strategy/CoG-saccadic averaging discussion: "The current study is not set up to distinguish between these two possibilities, although we briefly speculate about it in the General Discussion. For now, we prefer to simply use the empirical results from previous studies in order to formulate hypotheses for our current study."
- About the fact that the majority of our objects were heavier on the non-handle side: "For only 3 out of 14 objects, the CoG was shifted towards the handle side. We emphasize that we do not consider this a confound or a disadvantage of our design. After all, the purpose was to investigate whether such (asymmetries in) stimulus properties (which most likely also hold for other stimulus sets of graspable objects) provide an alternative explanation for previously-reported handle-affordance or action-performing effects."
