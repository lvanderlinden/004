# TODO manuscript 004:

## Journal:
If we change to JoV I have to look into the requirements!

## To read:
- Kaufman & Richards (1969)
- Richards & Kaufman (1969)

## Intro:

### Chapeau:
- Previously, low-level influences were typically compared with influences of cognition (cf readig).
- In natural scenes, however, there are potentials for action. Previous literature suggets that action could play a role.

Phrasing the intro this way:
- fits into the literature
- but is still original

### Order of sub paragraphs:
- Affordance - action direction - COG:
	- Advantages: 
		- actio priming theories make sense after intro
		- when starting with cog, people wonder why we ever thought it would not be the case with our objects
	- Disadvantage:
		- we can't say that cog was not taken into account at the end of the first 2 paragraphs
				
### CoG:
	
#### CoG vs PVL?
- Explain the difference?
- Rephrase it as being pulled towards vs strategy

#### See review Vitu 2008

	
	

### 


## Method:
- Why edge detection? See something about it + reference (Finlday vs McCowan)

## Analysis:
- LMM instead of ANOVA's vs t-tests

## Saliency simulation:
- Not in separate paragraph
- FV: in general discussion. I prefer putting it under Exp. 2
