## Saccadic averaging/Center-of-gravity hypothesis (FV) versus PVL/ strategy (Antje):
I agree that the difference between the two had to be made explicit, as both of you suggested.
However, our study was set up to test the CoG hypothesis, and not to test Antje's hypothesis. Therefore, we can only conclude that our results are in line with the former, and not that they are inconsistent with the latter. At best, we can very briefly speculate about it, which I did in the Discussion.

## Y-coordinates of landing positions:
The study is designed to investigate landing positions on the x-axis, and not on the y-axis. Participants showed a huge undershoot on the y-axis, which is not surprising. Only includig 'on-object' landing positions is impossible, because this is only the minority of saccades (and therefore not representative of participants 'normal' eye-movement behaviour?). I think it's best not to show y-coordinates at all.

## Response times:
I deleted everything about the affordance effect on RTs because the effects were not significant (Exp 1: p = .18, Exp. 2: p = .17). This is probably because you typically need more PPs to find a significant affordance effect. I don't think leaving this out is 'cheating' out because of the following (but I'll put it back in if one of you wants that, or when a reviewer asks about it): The main reason to orient our objects with their handles towards the left or right was to be able to dissociate overall left- or rightwards biases from object-related biases. Examing the effect of this manipulation on RT's was only an extra.

## Quadratic vs linear relationship second saccades (= refixations):
We did a linear regression to investigate the relationship between saccade latency and landing positions. This worked really well for the first saccade. However, the bin means of the second saccade show a u-curve. Still, I decided not to use a different test here, because the main thing that we want to say about the refixations is that they are significantly different from zero. And the current analysis is still perfect to do that (by looking at the intercept and its CIs). The only thing that becomes problematic is interpreting the slope, but this part (saying whether the bias changes/ becomes stronger over time) is particularly important for the first, but not for the second saccade. I briefly explain this in the Methods section of Exp 1.
