Purpose of the study:
	
	FV: Theoretically guided.
		
	LL: 
		- Purpose is to see whether handle indeed immediately and automatically captures visual attention, as measured by landing positions. To make other possible outcomes meaningfull as well, two other hypotheses are added: 
			- a bias towards the other side would be in line with Humphreys et al.
			- no bias to either side, relative to the CoG, would be in line with GE.
	- The experiment is NOT set up to distinguish between CoG and PVL as a strategy. 
	- I do not want to include the information hypothesis, because this is more a post-hoc explanation that we came up with. There is no reference for it, and I did not systematically manipulate it (i.e., for some objects the informative side = the handled side).
	
Hypotheses:
	FV: First CoG, high-level effects come into play only later on.
	
	LL: Previous theory suggests that at least the affordance effect is AUTOMATIC AND EARLY
		

Intro:
	Theoretically guided differently.
	
Presentation of results:
	- All LME instead of a combination of all kinds of tests.
	- Mention other factors that I manipulated.
	- Move distributions to main text.
	
	LL:
	- Gap was just to have a wider range of latencies. It was not crossed in the factorial design. Eccentricity was a random number varying between 5 and 7.
	- The dv = bias to the handle. If this dv is not influenced by Handle Orientation or Response Hand, we don't have to consider these factors.

Conclusions:
	
	FV:
		Different theoretical implications!!
		1. Eyes move to CoG of real objects -> never shown before (only for shapes and contours), suggesting that:
			- the primacy of low-level visuomotor effects
			- CoG mechamisms are the default
			- but also:
				- argues against the idea that the eyes move towards the center voluntarily (PVL, Antje).
		2. Time course of CoG vs high-level -> also never shown before with real objects. It can only be done in simple tasks like mine.
		
		3. According to saliency models the eyes go to most salient locations. However, this is probably confounded with CoG. Therefore: we should contrast CoG and saliency.
		
	LL: People should take CoG into account.
