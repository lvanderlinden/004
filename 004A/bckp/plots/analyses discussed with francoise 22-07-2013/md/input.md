# Labeling
For all plots the label *first saccade* refers to the large, towards-object saccade. The labels *second* and *third* saccade refer to the first and second within-object refixations. For the latter two saccades I used the *time from stimulus onset* as the latency.

For *Experiment 1* the center of the bitmap was aligned to the vertical meridian.
For *Experiment 2* the center of gravity of the bitmap was aligned to the vertical meridian.

The term *Uncorrected* indicates that the original (drift-corrected) landing positions are used.
The term *Corrected* indicates that the deviation between the center of the bitmap and the center of gravity are subtracted
from the original (drift-corrected) landing position (only applicable for Experiment 1).

# Landing positions as a function of handle
During our meeting on Monday I showed that Center of Gravity (CoG) only affects the landing position of the first, towards-object saccade. For the subsequent within-object refixations the eyes land away from the handle. They do so in both experiments, and regardless of whether we correct for the CoG or not. This effect is stronger for the second than the third saccade.

The question arised whether the tendency for the refixations, but not the initial saccades, to land towards the non-handled (semantically-most-informative) part of the object, is solely caused by the fact that for the refixations *more time has passed since stimulus onset*. To investigate this, we decided to plot the built-up of the tendency to land away from the handle over time. We also decided to compare this timecourse to the timecourse of the effect of Contrast Side on landing position. The reasoning behind the latter comparison was that the top-down influence of the most-informative part of the object should occur later than the bottom-up effect of contrast.

To investigate those questions I did the following:
	
# Binning
I looked at the landing positions as a function of saccade latency. More specifically, I binned the latencies of the first, the second and the third saccade. For the plots below I did the binning per participant instead of across participants (but 'withinizing' or not makes virtually no difference). 

# Effect of Handle Side and effect of Contrast Side
I did this separately for the effect of Handle Side (first three plots, where positive landing positions indicate saccades *towards the handle*, and negative positions indicate away from the handle) and the effect of Contrast Side (second three plots, where positive landing positions indicate saccades *towards the most-contrast side*). 

For the effect of handle I only included the trials on which contrast was NOT manipulated, and for the effect of contrast I only included the trials on which contrast WAS manipulated.

# Interpretation
Although in my opinion all distribution analyses are somewhat messy, I still tried to make some inferences below. I have some trouble to distinguish between effects of 'time since stimulus onset' (i.e. the values on the x-axis) and 'saccade count' (the colored lines).

## Effect of Contrast
In Experiment 1, in general participants made saccades towards the most-contrasted side. In contrast to our hypothesis, the effect of Contrast on landing position does not diminish over time. Instead, the distribution appears to be slightly U-curved, where the second saccade and/or the saccades falling in a moderately-long Stimulus-Saccade interval are slightly less directed to the most-contrast side. 

The distribution of Experiment 2 appears somewhat U-curved as well. In contrast to Experiment 1, for some bins the average landing position was *away* from the most-contrast side. The probability of looking at the masked side of the object depended on saccade count (i.e., most likely for the second saccade), and time passed since stimulus onset (most likely for saccades falling in a moderately-long Stimulus-Saccade interval). Note that the *first saccade* appears to be directed to the most-contrast side (i.e. *away* from the masked side) regardless of time passed since stimulus onset.

## Effect of Handle
In contrast to our hypothesis, the landing positions of the latest first saccades do not resemble the landing positions of the earliest refixations. However, *in line with our hypothesis*, the tendency to land towards the non-handled, most-informative part of the object *does* already built-up as a function of time for the first saccade. 
Again, the distribution is U-curved, indicating that second saccades and/or moderately-late saccades are more likely to be directed to the non-handled part of the object, whereas this tendency is diminished for the third and/or very late saccades.

# Interaction with Gap Condition
Given the results from the distribution analyses described above, I investigated whether the effect of Handle Side on initial landing position would interact with the effect of Gap Condition such that there would already be a slight tendency to land towards the non-handled side in the Gap Overlap condition. However, this doesn't appear to be the case (none of the interactions reached significance). This is probably because the distributions of the Gap Zero and Gap Overlap trials largely overlap.
