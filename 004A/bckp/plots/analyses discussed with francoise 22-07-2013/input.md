# Labeling:
Note that the *first saccade* is the large, towards-object saccade. The *second* and the *third* saccade are the first and second within-object refixations. For the latter two saccades I used the *time from stimulus onset* as the latency.

For *experiment 1* the center of the bitmap was aligned to the vertical meridian.
For *experiment 2* the center of gravity of the bitmap was aligned to the vertical meridian.

*Uncorrected* means that the original (drift-corrected) landing positions are used.
*Corrected* means that the deviation between the center of the bitmap and the center of gravity are subtracted
from the original landing position (only applicable for Experiment 1).


# Landing positions as a function of handle per saccade:
During our meeting on Monday I showed that Center of Gravity (CoG) only affects the landing position of the first, towards-object saccade. For the subsequent within-object refixations the eyes land away from the handle. They do so in both experiments, and regardless of whether we correct for CoG or not. The effect is stronger for the second than the third saccade.

The question arised whether the absence of a CoG-effect in the refixations is solely caused by the fact that for those saccades *more time has passed since stimulus onset*. To investigate this, we decided to investigate the built-up of the tendency to land *away* from the handle (i.e. *towards* the semantically-most-informative part) over time. We also decided to compare this timecourse to the timecourse of the effect of Contrast Side on landing position. The reasoning behind the latter comparison was that the top-down influence of the most-informative part of the object should occur later than the bottom-up effect of contrast.

To investigate those questions I did the following:

# Binning:
I looked at the landing positions as a function of saccade latency as you suggested during our meeting on Monday. More specifically, I binned the latencies of the first, the second and the third saccade. For the plots attached I did the binning per participant instead of across participants (but 'withinizing' or not makes virtually no difference). 

# Effect of Handle Side and effect of Contrast Side:
I did this separately for the effect of Handle Side (first three plots, where positive landing positions indicate saccades towards the handle, and negative positions indicate away from the handle) and the effect of Contrast Side (second three plots, where positive landing positions indicate saccades towards the most-contrast side). 

For the effect of handle I only included the trials on which contrast was NOT manipulated, and for the effect of contrast I only included the trials on which contrast WAS manipulated.


# Interpretation:
