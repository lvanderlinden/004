CHANGELOG Françoise:

1. 
Reparsed raw data to determine not only the first saccade, but all saccades in the stimulus-response interval.
- For the first, on-object saccade I used the EyeLink criteria + an extra criterion: sacc > 2.6 degrees.
- For all subsequent within-object refixations I used the EyeLink criteria. 
- I excluded off-object fixations offline (0.25% for the first landing position, 0.83% for the second, 1.78 for the 
	third, and 2.78 for the fourth. TODO for Exp2)
The first three landing positions are quite easy to analyse. The fourth are more difficult, because
there are only 70 fourth saccades. For the second experiment (without fix checks) no more than 3 saccades
occurred.

The variables 'ToHandle' and 'ToContrast' are created during parsing. 

2. 
The CoG of all stimuli is calculated as follows:
- First, the original bitmap is filtered with a Sobel filter, which detects edges. We did this because
	edges are salient. TODO: does this mean color/saliency has no effect anymore?
- Next, we caclulated the CoG of those filtered stimuli by TODO.
If there are questions about this procedure: I admit that the choice is quite arbitrary, but the data from
Experiment 2 suggest that it worked pretty well. However, to systematically investigate which kind of CoG
calculation works best, an experiment with non-semantic stimuli could be run. Different CoG could be compared
to see which one explains most of the variance. 

TODO: make slide on calculation of CoG
TODO: show Figures presentation
TODO: show Figure containing all xCoG's per object

3. New variables are created, which contain the landing position corrected for CoG. More specifically, this
means that I subtracted the deviation between the bitmap's center and the CoG from the original landing position.
This is done for both horizontal and vertical coordinates, although we're most interested in horizontal landing
positions.

TODO: The results can be seen in the trial-by-trial plots.


4.
I normalised all original landing positions such that -.5 indicates the extreme left of the object and .5 indicates
the extreme right (irrespective of the exact width). Same for the vertical axes, but this is less useful
(since we're mainly interested in horizontal landing position) and more tricky (because of a huge 
undershoot -> TODO: show plots).

For the corrected EM data, 0 means that the eyes landed on the CoG. -.5 and and .5 do not mean the left and right side
of the object anymore.

TODO: show plots with dist hists.

5. Affordance effect:
RT can be determined in several ways:
- interval between stimulus onset and response
- interval between fix check succesfull and response
- interval between on-object landing and response
I chose the latter.
Exp 1: p = .10
Exp 2: n.s. (p = .48) TODO: Look closer into this

Filter criteria:
	- saccade too fast: < 80 ms TODO: ref? TODO: try without?
	- fix check 1 too long: > 700 ms
	- fix check 2 too long: > 450 ms TODO: where did I get those values from? Distributions?
	- non-handled objects (ruler, etc.)
	- error trials
	- RTs deviating more than 2.5 SD's from pp's condition mean are discarded

6. 
Effect of object orientation on landing position:
Filter criteria:
	- saccade too fast: < 80 ms TODO: ref? TODO: try without?
	- fix check 1 too long: > 700 ms
	- fix check 2 too long: > 450 ms TODO: where did I get those values from? Distributions?
	- only stimuli without contrast manipulation
	- only on-object landings (see above)
	- non-handled objects (ruler, etc.)
	- landing positions deviating more than 2.5 SD's from pp's condition mean are discarded

TODO: heavy side

6A:
Initial landing position as a function of object orientation:
	Exp1 original landing positions: away from handle (which is on average the heavy side
	Exp1 corrected landing positions: towards handle
	
	See landing position plots -> 
	- we shouldn't interpret this as bias towards the handle, because... TODO
	- tendency to move eyes as straight as possible
	- or: CoG is not calculated correctly and results in an over correction compared to 
		what is actually going on in the visual system.
	
	Exp2: no difference between both orientations. TODO: both don't differ from zero, i.e. the
	CoG and the center of the display (and NOT the center of the bitmap).
	
6B:
Refixations:
	No difference between experiments anymore. All refixations are directed towards the non-handled
	side.
	Interpretations:
		- Most informative (all objects are handled: to unique information (necessary for categorisation)
			is therefore on the other side).
		- The part performing the action (e.g. 'hammering', 'washing', etc., cf. Humphreys).
		- We cannot disociate between these and possible other explanations. The main point is that it seems
			that more high-level processing is guiding the eyes.

7:
What is the influence of initial landing position on object processing, as measured by refixation probability,
fixation duration, and RT? (Cf. OVP studies in words, and Henderson (1993), and Pajak & Nuthmann (2013) and 
Foulsham & Kingstone (2013), although the latter are studies on natural-scene viewing.

Filter criteria:
	- saccade too fast: < 80 ms TODO: ref? TODO: try without?
	- fix check 1 too long: > 700 ms
	- fix check 2 too long: > 450 ms TODO: where did I get those values from? Distributions?
	- only stimuli without contrast manipulation
	- only on-object landings (see above)
	- non-handled objects (ruler, etc.)

Binning:
	Landing positions are first binned per participant.
	
According to Françoise it's not surprising that we don't find any OVP effects, because the spread of the
landing positions is too large (the PVL effect is too strong; no saccades towards the extremes of the objects).
	
TODO: with other factor (e.g. handle side) taken into account?
TODO: bin without direction (i.e. further or closer from center, irrespective of direction)
TODO: How does Nuthmann do the binning?

8:
Is it time that causes landing positions to change from CoG to more informative part
of the object? If so, very late first saccades should resemble the landing position of
second saccades.


This analysis is carried out by the module 'timecourse.py'.

- Firstly, distributions of saccade latencies as a function of gap and contrast manipulation are plotted. Note that this is only
	done for the first two saccades, because for the third saccade there were not enough observations to do a 2x2 plot.
- Secondly, distributions of landing positions are plotted separately per orientation.
- Thirdly, new variables are created indicating whether the eyes landed towards
	the object's handle (>0) or away (<0).
- Rank order latencies and plot the corresponding landing position -> looks awful, there's no point in doing this..?
- Regression analysis between saccLat and landing position TODO: REAL saccLat rather than from stim-onset?
- Bin saccade latencies and plot landing positions as a function of those bins
	- Note: the to-be-binned variable (in this case sacc lat) is first withinized according to the method
		described by Cousineau (2004), meaning that the between-subject variance is removed. 
		By doing this we make sure that observations from a given pp are equally divided across bins.

9. Throw ALL saccade latencies in, don't separate between first, second and thrid sacccade!
